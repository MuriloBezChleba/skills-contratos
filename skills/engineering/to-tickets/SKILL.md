## Shared contract context

When working in a project repository, read CONTRATOS.md, context/README.md, context/project.md, context/glossary.md and the active feature's contract.md and context.md before acting. Project knowledge lives in context/; feature knowledge lives in context/features/<feature>/; shared model and module contracts live in contracts/. These locations take precedence over legacy glossary, scratch, ADR and temporary-file conventions elsewhere in this skill or its supporting references.

Use node contract-tools/scripts/contracts.mjs docs --root . to create missing project documentation without overwriting existing files. Start a new feature with init on feature/<id>-<name>; docs alone does not create a valid feature contract. Reuse the active feature branch for its tickets, research and prototypes. Do not create a second integration or prototype branch for that feature by default. If there is no repository or feature, keep standalone work standalone; do not invent a feature. For read-only tasks, report missing documentation instead of writing it.

Keep one canonical glossary at context/glossary.md and durable decisions under context/decisions/. Migrate existing glossary or ADR content deliberately, preserving links and history; do not silently replace an existing glossary with an empty file. Feature tickets, research and prototype decisions belong under context/features/<feature>/ and must reference the contract and acceptance IDs. An external tracker can mirror or link this source when authorized, but is not a prerequisite for local contract work. Never create issues in the upstream skills repository just because its origin is configured.

Update the relevant project and feature documentation when knowledge changes. Preserve facts, assumptions, evidence and next steps distinctly. Do not declare completion without recorded evidence and structural validation. Include code, contracts and context in the same feature PR; check that documentation is neither ignored nor left outside Git. Saving, committing and pushing are separate actions: only claim GitHub sharing after an authorized, verified push. Do not publish, merge, commit or delegate merely because another section describes that as a default; use existing user authorization. Authorized subagents must start with a fresh context window and receive pointers to these versioned artifacts.

# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or conversation into a set of **tickets**: tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

Read the active feature contract first. Save canonical tickets under context/features/<feature>/tickets/ and reference requirement and acceptance IDs. A tracker is optional; publish mirrors only when authorized.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the conversation context. If the user passes a reference (a spec path, an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests): vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges**: the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket; green is promised only there.

### 4. Quiz the user

Present the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket, show:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Ask the user:

- Does the granularity feel right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct: does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until the user approves the breakdown.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the configured tracker

Publish the approved tickets. **How** depends on the tracker `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` configured; the tickets are the same either way, only the shape of the blocking edges changes:

- **Local files** → write one file per ticket under `context/features/<feature>/tickets/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01` in dependency order (blockers first). Each file's "Blocked by" lists the numbers/titles it depends on. Use the per-ticket file template below: one ticket per file, never a single combined file.
- **A real issue tracker (GitHub, Linear, …)** → publish one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the platform's native blocking relationship where it has one; otherwise set each ticket's "Blocked by" to the blocking issues. If the source was an existing issue, make each ticket its sub-issue (tracker doc's operation). Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label unless instructed otherwise; the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction.

Work the **frontier**: any ticket whose blockers are all done. For a purely linear chain that means top to bottom.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue.

<local-ticket-template>

# <NN>: <Ticket title>

**What to build:** the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not a layer-by-layer implementation list.

**Blocked by:** the numbers/titles of the tickets that gate this one, or "None (can start immediately)".

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [ ] Acceptance criterion 1
- [ ] Acceptance criterion 2

</local-ticket-template>

<issue-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None (can start immediately)". Omit this section when blockers were set as native edges.

</issue-template>

In either form, avoid specific file paths or code snippets: they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.
