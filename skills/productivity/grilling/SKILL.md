## Shared contract context

When working in a project repository, read CONTRATOS.md, context/README.md, context/project.md, context/glossary.md and the active feature's contract.md and context.md before acting. Project knowledge lives in context/; feature knowledge lives in context/features/<feature>/; shared model and module contracts live in contracts/. These locations take precedence over legacy glossary, scratch, ADR and temporary-file conventions elsewhere in this skill or its supporting references.

Use node contract-tools/scripts/contracts.mjs docs --root . to create missing project documentation without overwriting existing files. Start a new feature with init on feature/<id>-<name>; docs alone does not create a valid feature contract. Reuse the active feature branch for its tickets, research and prototypes. Do not create a second integration or prototype branch for that feature by default. If there is no repository or feature, keep standalone work standalone; do not invent a feature. For read-only tasks, report missing documentation instead of writing it.

Keep one canonical glossary at context/glossary.md and durable decisions under context/decisions/. Migrate existing glossary or ADR content deliberately, preserving links and history; do not silently replace an existing glossary with an empty file. Feature tickets, research and prototype decisions belong under context/features/<feature>/ and must reference the contract and acceptance IDs. An external tracker can mirror or link this source when authorized, but is not a prerequisite for local contract work. Never create issues in the upstream skills repository just because its origin is configured.

Update the relevant project and feature documentation when knowledge changes. Preserve facts, assumptions, evidence and next steps distinctly. Do not declare completion without recorded evidence and structural validation. Include code, contracts and context in the same feature PR; check that documentation is neither ignored nor left outside Git. Saving, committing and pushing are separate actions: only claim GitHub sharing after an authorized, verified push. Do not publish, merge, commit or delegate merely because another section describes that as a default; use existing user authorization. Authorized subagents must start with a fresh context window and receive pointers to these versioned artifacts.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round: number each question and give your recommended answer. Then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

Format a round like so:

```
❓ **Q1** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>

---

❓ **Q2** - **<question title>**: <question body, might be multiple paragraphs, including multiple choices>

➡️ <your recommended answer>
```

Word each question so "yes" accepts your recommended answer.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent with a fresh context window to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Do not act on it until the user confirms you have reached a shared understanding.
